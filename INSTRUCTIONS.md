# Webcurry.co Redesign — Farmer Instructions

## Context
- Project path: `~/master\ Codex/projects/webcurry-redesign`
- Goal: Redesign the commercial site for webcurry.co with a modern, full-width, multi-page experience that includes new interactive elements (chatbots, popups, sliders, mega menus, WhatsApp, niche-specific tools).
- Operating principle: Architecture-first; plan before building; production-ready quality; challenge assumptions.
- Note: Add “Architecture-First Development Principles” near the top of your `claude.md`.

## Master (Pre-handover) Responsibilities
- Analyse the existing site and draft a redesign plan.
- Document all current site pages in detail (structure, content, CTAs, media).
- Collect all images from every page, crop for reuse, and name them by source page.
- Gather business info (contact details, addresses, hours, social links).
- Ensure all logos are collected in available formats.
- Identify and document current theme colour codes.
- Define and document the proposed colour theme for the new site.
- Organise all collected assets clearly and recheck before handover to Farmer.

## Farmer Responsibilities
- Receive organised assets, documentation, and the plan; confirm understanding.
- Design and develop the new site to commercial standards with full-width layout.
- Configure Git with correct access for all personas per Farmer creation notes.
- Use the approved development stack and shared resources; spin up on farm instance once ready.
- Push changes to Git after every update (frequent commits).
- Apply the Intelligence Access Love and Hate system for setup/access control.

## Development Notes (for Farmer)
- Multi-page commercial-grade site; responsive and accessible.
- Include interactive elements: chatbots, popups, sliders, mega menus, WhatsApp integration, and useful niche tools.
- Prioritise usability, performance, SEO, and WCAG AA accessibility.
- Integrations must enhance business value and fit requirements; avoid noisy UX.
- Keep secrets/env vars externalised; document setup steps.

## Delivery Expectations
- Provide architecture/approach brief before implementation.
- Keep `TASKS.md` aligned with progress; update TODOs with timestamps/status.
- Document run/build/test/deploy steps and any account or integration notes.
